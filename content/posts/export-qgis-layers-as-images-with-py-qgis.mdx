With the help of [PyQGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/de/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html "PyQGIS") processes such as the export of images for all layers from a map can be automated.

First of all, of course, you need one or more layers with raster and/or vector data.

## Add layers with PyQGIS

If all files are in the same folder, they can be read in with a ["for .. in loop](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp" Python For Loops "). You can also use`. endswith (". gpkg") `, for example, only files with the extension" .gpkg "are searched, and when the layers are added, each layer name is packed into an array that will be needed later.

```py
    import os, sys
    from PyQt5.QtCore import QTimer

    # path to look for files
    path = "ordner/nocheinordner/"
    # set path
    dirs = os.listdir( path )
    # array for storing layer_names
    layer_list = []
    # variable for further processing
    count = 0
    #look for files inpath
    for file in dirs:
    	# search for ".gpkg" files
        if file.endswith(".gpkg"):
    		#add vectorlayers
            vlayer = iface.addVectorLayer(path + file, "Layername", "ogr")
            layer_list.append(vlayer.name())
```

The new vector layers then appear in the QGIS layer tree.

## Image export for each layer

If you are satisfied with the display, two small functions can be used to export a georeferenced image for each layer.

```py
    def prepareMap():
        # make all layers invisible
    	iface.actionHideAllLayers().trigger()
        # get layer by layer_name
    	layer_name = QgsProject.instance().mapLayersByName(layer_list[count])[0]
        # select layer
    	iface.layerTreeView().setCurrentLayer(layer_name)
        # set selected layer visible
    	iface.actionShowSelectedLayers().trigger()
        # Wait a second and export the map
    	QTimer.singleShot(1000, exportMap)
```

The "prepareMap ()" function first deactivates all layers. A layer is then selected from the "layer_list" array using its layer name and then displayed again. The QTimer class is particularly important here. Before an image is created, there must always be a short wait before the selected layer is really visible. Without QTimer, the script would run so quickly that the result would be loud images with the same content. After waiting a second, the "exportMap" function is called.

```py
    def exportMap():
        global count
    	# save current view as image
        iface.mapCanvas().saveAsImage( path + layer_list[count] + ".png" )
    	# feedback for printed map
        print('{}.png exported sucessfully'.format(layer_list[count]))
    	# get map for every layer in layer_list
        if count < len(layer_list)-1:
    		# Wait a second and prepare next map (timer is needed because otherwise all images have the samec content
    		# the script excecutes faster then the mapCanvas can be reloaded
            QTimer.singleShot(1000, prepareMap)
        count += 1
```

Now the current map, in which only one level is shown, is saved as a PNG image in the source directory. Ultimately, you "land" in a loop that goes through all the layers that are in the "layer_list" array and calls the "prepareMap" function for each layer again.
